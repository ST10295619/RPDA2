    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation**:\n",
    "   - The dataset is loaded, and categorical variables (`Impact`, `Urgency`, `Priority`) are encoded using `LabelEncoder`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering**:\n",
    "   - The encoded features are used to predict the `Response Time`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Training**:\n",
    "   - A Random Forest Regressor is trained on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluation**:\n",
    "   - The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).\n",
    "   - A scatter plot is created to visualize the actual vs. predicted response times.\n",
